A backtracking algorithm for solving a maze

The problem is solved using a DFS approach.
# Output
1. The first major chunk you would see is the representation of the current maze. It displays all the paths a Node can take. The final Node (32) is final and hence points to nothing.

2. The second piece of output is the algorithm. It displays each step that it goes through, including backtracking.

3. Finally the sequence of states required for the solution is printed out, excluding the initial state.
